# The Weather App

A simple app where users can use for travelling to different countries or state to search on the current weather.

# Background

This app was created for users who would like a fast and brief information on the weather condition of country and or states.

# How it works

Users simply enter the name of the country or state that they would like to know of in the search bar and press enter. It will give the results of the latest weather temperature, date and time and the weather condition.

Users can also search multiple places and there will be a history of their last searched country or state so that they will not need the hassle of typing to refer back to their previous search.
